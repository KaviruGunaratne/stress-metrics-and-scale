These files contain the results of the ground-truth experiments. The ground truth experiments take random samples of 10,000 from both Fashion MNIST and MNIST and uses the entire Spambase dataset, which has around 7,000 samples, to determine the rankings of either UMAP, MDS, and Random or t-SNE, MDS, and Random for initial stress, “true” stress, and Shepard goodness score. The number of times out of 10 trials that these rankings for either UMAP, MDS, and Random or t-SNE, MDS, and Random agree with their expected rankings, which are MDS, UMAP, and Random and MDS, t-SNE, and Random, respectively, was recorded. ‘experiment_orderings_tsne.csv’ contains the results from the ground truth experimentation for t-SNE, MDS, and Random, and ‘experiment_orderings_umap.csv’ contains the results from the ground truth experimentation for UMAP, MDS, and Random. ‘experiment_results_tsne.csv’ contains a table that displays the number of times out of 10 that the expected order of t-SNE, MDS, and Random agrees with the ranking obtained from each of the three aforementioned measures by dataset. ‘experiment_results_umap.csv’ contains a table that displays the number of times out of 10 that the expected order of UMAP, MDS, and Random agrees with the ranking obtained from each of the three measures again by dataset.
