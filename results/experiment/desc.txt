These tables contain the initial stress score, the “true” stress score obtained by scaling the low-dimensional projection and then calculating the minimum, the scalar that resulted in this “true” stress score, and the Shepard goodness score of the respective datasets across 10 trials for t-SNE, MDS, UMAP, and Random. The last row of each table also includes the average across the 10 trials for each column.
